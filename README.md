Bank Marketing Data Analysis

Remember to put the data set in the same folder as your python file

For this project, the bank marketing dataset1 will be used and it can be downloaded from the course’s datasets folder (bank_marketing_data.csv). The dataset contains information collected during a bank’s direct marketing campaign which was conducted in order to convince people to sign-up/purchase a term-deposit product. In addition to personal information, this dataset contains also information regarding the current and previous marketing campaigns in relation to each particular person, as well as some external information (socio-economic indicators) which are independent of the particular person, but dependent on the time contact was made. More specifically, the dataset contains the following columns:
1.	age: the person’s age. Numerical
2.	job: the person’s job type. Categorical
3.	marital: the person’s marital status. Categorical
4.	education: the person’s educational level. Categorical
5.	default: indicates whether the person has credit in default. Categorical
6.	housing: indicates whether the person has housing a loan. Categorical
7.	loan: indicates whether the person has a personal loan. Categorical
8.	contact: indicates how the customer was contacted for the current campaign. Categorical
9.	month: indicates the most recent month of year during which the customer was contacted for the current campaign. Categorical
10.	day_of_week: indicates the most recent contact day of the week during which the customer was contacted for the current campaign. Categorical
11.	campaign: the number of times this customer was contacted during this campaign. Numerical 
12.	pdays: indicates the number of days that passed, after the customer was last contacted from a previous campaign. Numerical. Note that 999 means that customer was not previously contacted
13.	previous: number of times this customer was contacted before this campaign. Numerical
14.	poutcome: the outcome of the previous marketing campaign with respect to this customer. Categorical
15.	emp.var.rate: the country’s employment variation rate. Socio-economic indicator. Numeric
16.	cons.price.idx: the country’s consumer price index. Socio-economic indicator. Numeric
17.	cons.conf.idx: the country’s consumer confidence index. Socio-economic indicator. Numeric
18.	euribor3m: the Euribor 3-month rate. Socio-economic indicator. Numeric
19.	nr.employed: the number of employees. Socio-economic indicator. Numeric
20.	y: indicates whether the customer signed-up for a term deposit account. Categorical

The general purpose of this project is to develop three classification models in order to predict whether a customer will purchase/sign-up for a term deposit product/account. Of course, to do that you will first need to prepare and explore the data. You will then evaluate your models and try to calibrate them to get better results – you are not expected to achieve a significant improvement over the models’ accuracy. Some improvement nevertheless, is possible and should be achieved.
